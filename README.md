# hello-world

Once upon a time, I was stuck in a room with nothing but a strange object. Now this was in 1820, so this object was wildly unusual to me. 
As I looked closely at that strange object, I realized that this object must not have come from this world. 
What was it? I wondered. Who brought here anyways and why?
The doornob in my room shifted, and then it unlocked, and there comes a man wearing a... uh, what would you call that thing he's wearing? 
The man suddenly said, "You must be wondering: 'Why on earth is there an alien object in this room that I am in?' Now, you have the right to be astounded. This object, by the way, is an Zexo 20940, and it is one of the grandest technology devices that will save the human race and everything on this planet. We have some visitors from another galaxy that will be visiting us quite soon. Which is why I came here, Austin, I need your help."
